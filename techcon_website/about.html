            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>At TechCon, our journey began with a simple but powerful vision: to create technology that
                empowers people and transforms industries. Founded in 2022, we started as a small team of passionate
                engineers and designers driven by curiosity and a commitment to solve real-world problems through
                innovation. </p>
            <p>What began as a modest startup has grown into a dynamic technology company delivering solutions across
                software development, digital transformation, cloud technologies, and AI-driven platforms. Over the
                years, we've expanded our reach globally, partnered with forward-thinking organizations, and built a
                culture rooted in excellence, creativity, and continuous learning.</p>
